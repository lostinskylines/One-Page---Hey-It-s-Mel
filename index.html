    <p>I have years of experience in promotions, photography, content management and graphic design. Recently I've been developing my front end web development skills and hope to continue to build on those in the future. I have been mostly involved in entertainment &amp; media industries (music, radio, comedy and now, video games), and enjoy working in these fast paced, social and focused environments. </p>

        <p>Most recently I worked on the concept and creative for our week-long Black Friday Sale. Black Friday is a huge commercial opportunity for all e-commerce sites, as you know, and when done right can reap some excellent rewards. We opted to stick with simple and clear messaging. Once this was agreed and the copy was decided, I set about creating over 100 assets in 4 languages in order to populate the site, social, email and affiliate channels. Here are some of the concepts I created, the featured copy was placeholding.</p></div>
